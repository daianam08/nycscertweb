    Below is one snipet of the code that I am proud of. It took me a while to figure out some of the conditions of the game.

    <h4>
    Creating an unplugged activity  
    </h4>
  </a>
    <p>
      This one was fun to make with the people in my group. I am not one for unplugged activities but
      I like the one we created because it is a good starting point when teaching concepts like Random
      and conditionals in a fun way.
    </p>
    <div style="background-color: #fae7e6; magin: 5px;">
      <p>
        Task <br>
        Students will be tasked to create their own game that includes 1-2 players, 2 dice, and conditionals similar to the example. <br>
        The game of Craps will be shown as an example (we will use a different name in class so we avoid teaching gambling). <br>
      <h5> Differentiation </h5>
        * Mild: Create a simple game that involves one of either IF or ELSE. <br>
        * Medium: Create a game that involves both IF and ELSE. <br>
        * Spicy: Create a game that involves at least 2 nested IF or ELSE statements. <br>
