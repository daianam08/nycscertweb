    Below is one snipet of the code that I am proud of. It took me a while to figure out some of the conditions of the game. <br>
    public static int playerRound(int pbag){
      Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
      if (pbag>3){
        System.out.println("Pull 1, 2, or 3 stones: ");
        int youPull = in.nextInt();
          if (youPull<=0 || youPull>3){
            System.out.println("Hey no cheating! Only pull 1, 2, or 3 stones: ");
            youPull = in.nextInt();
            } else {
              System.out.println("You pulled "+youPull+".");
              pbag=youPull;
          } return pbag;
        } else if(pbag>2){
          System.out.println("Pull 1 or 2 stones: ");
          int youPull = in.nextInt();
            if (youPull<=0 || youPull>2){
            System.out.println("Hey no cheating! Only pull 1 or 2 stones: ");
            youPull = in.nextInt();
            } else {
              System.out.println("You pulled "+youPull+".");
    youPull=pbag;
  } return pbag;
  } else if(pbag==1){
    System.out.println("Pull the last stone! ");
    int youPull = in.nextInt();
    if (youPull<=0 || youPull>2){
    System.out.println("Hey! Pull only 1:");
    youPull = in.nextInt();
    } else {
    System.out.println("You pulled "+youPull+".");
    youPull=pbag;
  } 
}  return pbag;//else if 1
} //end player
